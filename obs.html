Observability is the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs. A system is considered “observable” if the current state can be estimated by only using information from outputs, namely sensor data.

While it might seem like a recent buzzword, the term originated decades ago with control theory (which is about describing and understanding self-regulating systems). However, it has increasingly been applied to improving the performance of distributed IT systems. In this context, observability uses three types of telemetry data — metrics, logs and traces — to provide deep visibility into distributed systems and allow teams to get to the root cause of a multitude of issues and improve the system’s performance.

Over the last several years, enterprises have rapidly adopted cloud-native infrastructure services, such as AWS, in the form of microservice, serverless and container technologies. Tracing an event to its origin in these distributed systems requires thousands of processes running on the cloud, on-premise or both. But conventional monitoring techniques and tools struggle to track the many communication pathways and interdependencies in these distributed architectures.

Observability allows teams to:

Monitor modern systems more effectively
Find and connect effects in a complex chain and trace them back to their cause
Enable visibility for system administrators, IT operations analysts and developers into the entire architecture
In this article, we’ll take a closer look at observability: what it is, what it takes to implement and the benefits you can expect your organization to gain from it.
