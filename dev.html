You’ve just meticulously created your App. Your team has come together and gone from concept to wire frame to now a working version. The long hours have paid off, and you don’t have to detail an imaginative user interface when people ask; “Hey, what’s your team working on?” You know how the app works, your team knows how it works, and every first degree beta user you let give it a try, experiences it perfectly, because, well, you steer them away from those “sticky” points.
Before you pop the champagne bottle or set the notification emails for new downloads high marks, take a moment to evaluate what Quality Control, you and your team have done to set your app up for long-term success. Quality control can be the agonizing “do we really?” type agenda that deflates even the most motivated team. However, following these simple tips could be the difference in rolling out the Headline App of the year versus just another “app with so much potential.”
Automation
The developers can’t catch every bug that your app may encounter, making some form of automated testing essential. The best way to apply this is through tools like MyCrowd QA. The process is automated and requires less hands-on than what is the norm for a team. Bugs should never be the reason your app isn’t successful. Apply automation in identifying the bugs and you’ll take this off the list of risks for failing.

Staged Roll Out
Before you release your app to the marketplace, it’s a good idea to release it to a small group of users to monitor for issues. Thomas Weigt of BitSuites says this way if any bugs are detected or user sticking points arise, you can move the release date of the app until they are taken care of.

Marketplace monitoring
The reviews found in the App store will be your users’ primary way of getting the word to you that there is something wrong with your app. Make sure that you are checking in and addressing your users’ concerns. A bad review can really hurt you in the App store. Be sure to encourage good reviews as well. Loyal users and past champions of your apps will gladly help elevate your new release to the top charts if you give them good reason. Try sending release emails to your list of followers. Tell them why this app is important and how they can specifically ensure it is a success. Be sure to include a private form or contact for suggestions and improvements. Opening up this channel will give you a direct communication with your best users, without running the risk of seeing one star like feedback in the app store.

Don’t let users run the show
While this may sound contrary to what was just said, you shouldn’t let the users’ opinions rule your app. Though their feedback is important, it is equally important not to lose sight of your vision for the app. When dealing with user complaints, listen to their recommended solutions but refrain from making every detailed change someone mentions. “Game changers” in the app world, often carry a learning curve that users new to figure out. If you were to automatically take these away based on simple feedback, the bigger vision would likely fall to the waste side.

Classify your bugs
Distinguish and prioritize the issues that your app has. Danny Group, CEO Richard Wong, recommends classifying bugs as “critical” and “non-critical.” Critical bugs are those that cause errors and crashes. Non-critical bugs are those that don’t affect the overall performance of the app but are not satisfactory. Using a tool like MyCrowd QA will give you an ultimate list of bugs that exist. Your team can use it as a starting point to divide and conquer on the way to success.
