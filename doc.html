How do you maintain the quality of your software while making your testing efforts more efficient?
Back in my first post, I lamented the way that testing and code quality seemed to be little more than lip service in my prior employment experience and 
how I strove to change that perspective at my current company. I am very lucky to have the opportunity to attempt these changes and I feel that there have been many successes. Yet even with that opportunity, one thing doesnâ€™t change: there is SO MUCH that needs to be done. So how do you maintain the quality of your software while making your testing efforts more efficient? Spoiler alert: there is no silver bullet.
 However, here are some things that help us streamline testing.

 Planning
Having a plan for testing is essential to help streamline the process. 
It can be as informal as a checklist or as detailed as a complete list of tests, 
but defining the direction and scope of testing ahead of time is a huge time saver. 
You may want to see if there are some more efficient test automation tools that can be of use for this project and future ones too. 
It could help you streamline the process and get the results you need. Beware of putting too much effort into planning.
 The amount of planning should match the impact of the work. There is nothing more important than time, 
 and spending thirty minutes filling out test planning paperwork for a ten-second test kills productivity, enthusiasm, and momentum.
